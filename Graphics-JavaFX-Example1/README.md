# First JavaFX Example #

The provided example for a first very basic JavaFX application can be run as follows: You simply use **maven** and simply type in the command line _mvn clean package exec:java_ . This command will download all required dependencies, build and run the application.

Running the code in an IDE might be more complicated since some configuration options need to be setup correctly.
